                    <br></br>
                    (1972)
                    <br></br>
                    For certain books in the late 1960s and early 1970s, MIT Press avoided typesetters entirely, bringing that role in-house using the new electric typewriters with which Muriel was already experimenting. When a type galley required a correction, it was now only a matter of retyping the corrected section and the change could be made in a few hours rather than a few days. The corresponding savings in time, labor and money changed the economics of publishing for books that could work in this alternate typesetting. A few of the better known examples of this work produced at the Press in this manner include Herbert Muschamp’s first book, File Under Architecture and Donis A. Dondis’ A Primer of Visual Literacy.
                    <br></br>
                    These titles inevitably betray Muriel Cooper’s deep investment in synthesizing design with an intimate knowledge of production. File Under Architecture was produced entirely with the IBM Selectric typewriter, where quick and immediate typeface changes were as simple as replacing the typographic ball. Margins were set in multiple typefaces as a running commentary on the text itself. The book was printed on butcher’s paper and bound in corrugated cardboard. The result looks like the process that made it and reveals a deep engagement with and symbiotic relation between the design and production of the book.
