                    (1973)
                    <br></br> 
                    By 1974, Muriel had partnered with designer, artist and technician Ron MacNeil to teach a new graphic design class at MIT School of Architecture called Messages and Means.  Muriel was convinced that a workshop environment,where teaching happens in a feedback loop with hands-on production and design would work well.

                    They used the offset printing press as an artist ºs tool: they collaborated on platemaking and they altered the application of inks -- they rotated the paper to make printing an interactive medium.
                    <br></br>
                    Messages and Means students learned in a workshop environment how the printing press works by using it. Opening up access to this instrument, students were able to explore an intimate and immediate relationship to the means of production for their design work. The inevitable result was a merging of roles and blurring of specializations. In the workshop, students became editors, platemakers, printers, typesetters and designers all at one time, in overlapping and iterative configurations.
                     <br></br>
                    Students were independent, motivated and empowered to realize their projects as they wished. As a result, the course was consistently over-enrolled.
