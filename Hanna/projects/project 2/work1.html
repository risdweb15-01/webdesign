                    <br></br>
                    (1958)
                    <br></br>
                    The original inspiration behind the bars of the colophon can be detected in some of the details within the large geometric spattering: at the bottom of the page, a three-dimensional block shows the earlier cube-like rendering of an open book from the earlier logos settle into a row of book spines upon an absent shelf, with one very tall volume indicating the sudden surge of lower-case “t”, and the volume next to it dropping itself below shelf level to strain toward a lower-case “p.”
                    <br></br>
                    From complexity to simplicity: the goal of all effective communications design. The masthead letters of the MIT Press—“mitp”—rendered into their primal (pre-barcode-era) form.
                    <br></br>
                    The “totalizing” approach to design that Cooper brought to the Press (in which nothing escaped the design mission, and advertising, brochures, and letterhead received attention alongside the books that the Press published) already bore the legacy of the Bauhaus, which had made such an approach its guiding philosophy several decades earlier. But the modernism that the school embodied can be seen in kernel form in Cooper’s colophon: an embracement of the aesthetics and approach that mass production had introduced to the twentieth century, as well as a rejection of the emotional expressionism endemic to the German Expressionists that had immediately preceded the Bauhaus. It is thus completely fitting that the MIT Press book that not only officially made The MIT Press forever known as a “design press,” but remains one of Cooper’s biggest legacies in book design, is the 1969 publication of the English adaptation of Hans Wingler’s Bauhaus: Weimar, Dessau, Berlin, Chicago (later released in a paperback edition in 1978).
