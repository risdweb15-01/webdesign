                    <br></br>
                    (1973)
                    <br></br>
                    For certain books in the late 1960s and early 1970s, MIT Press avoided typesetters entirely, bringing that role in-house using the new electric typewriters with which Muriel was already experimenting. When a type galley required a correction, it was now only a matter of retyping the corrected section and the change could be made in a few hours rather than a few days. The corresponding savings in time, labor and money changed the economics of publishing for books that could work in this alternate typesetting. A few of the better known examples of this work produced at the Press in this manner include Herbert Muschamp’s first book, File Under Architecture and Donis A. Dondis’ A Primer of Visual Literacy.
                    <br></br>
                    A Primer of Visual Literacy was designed with Donis A. Dondis, a colleague and graphic design professor at Boston University. In Primer, all typesetting again was produced on an IBM Selectric Composer at the MIT Press. However, this time the result is not immediately recognizable as typewriting. The book was set in a monospaced version of Univers, a refined sans serif typeface designed by Adrian Friutiger (who had also designed the standard Courier letterforms.) The resulting book is a classic introductory graphic design textbook, produced today in its thirtieth printing. Many of its ideas mirror recurring concerns of Muriel Cooper in her work.
