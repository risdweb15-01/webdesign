                    <br></br>
                    (1972)
                    <br></br>
                    Learning from Las Vegas, originally published by the MIT Press in 1972, was one of the most influential and controversial architectural books of its era. Thirty-five years later, it remains a perennial bestseller and a definitive theoretical text. Its authors—architects Robert Venturi, Denise Scott Brown, and Steven Izenour—famously used the Las Vegas Strip to argue the virtues of the "ordinary and ugly" above the "heroic and original" qualities of architectural modernism. Learning from Las Vegas not only moved architecture to the center of cultural debates, it changed our ideas about what architecture was and could be.
                    <br></br>
                    As soon as she supports layout, Learning from Las Vegas in the fall of 1971 Muriel Cooper in direct conflict with the Venturi. The latter are actually sent to the MIT Press with a clear idea of what they want for their book. Within the Venturi and Rauch agency, they have already thought about the choice of illustrations, the text sizing, cutting parts, etc. They accuse her of an aesthetics of the blank page, and too close to the modernist simplicity they rightly criticized in the book. Muriel Cooper nevertheless strives to meet the authors who, in their text, speak to invent new devices to realize the unprecedented urban form of Las Vegas. They are static when Las Vegas is dynamic, contained where it is open, where it is two-dimensional three-dimensional. By the free assembly of the iconography, the asymmetrical composition of pages and dynamic design it designs, Muriel Cooper tries to immerse players in the heart of Las Vegas. Where Venturi want to paste text and so stick to a traditional layout, graphic designer offers extraordinary visual experience.
                    <br></br>
                        This disagreement on how to implement the intellectual struggle as it says in retrospect Muriel Cooper, akin to a struggle of egos between authors and publishers for the control of the publication. The disagreement is so deep that the MIT Press are finally set two editions, as evidenced post one of its leaders, Roger Conover: Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown found his offensive and insulting if their design ideas they threatened to withdraw their publication.
