                    <br></br>
                    (1969)
                    <br></br>
                    The “Bauhaus Bible”, as it’s widely known, contains the definitive collection of documents from the German art school through its multiple locations and bureaucratic arrangements. The book includes correspondence, descriptions of each workshop, budgets and photographs documenting the spaces of the school. Muriel described the subject matter of this book as a perfect fit, a coincidence of subject, designer and situation. The book design was given enough time to happen in a comprehensive manner and the stunning result reflects it. Muriel described the fortunate coincidence of subject matter and design brief:
                    <br></br>
                        "My design approach always emphasized
                        process over product, and what better
                        place to express this than in a tome
                        on the Bauhaus, the seminal exploration
                        of art and design in an industrial
                        revolution."
                    <br></br>
                    Throughout the book design, production constraints were treated as design opportunities. The color plates had to be salvaged from a previous German publication for economic reasons. This determined the unusually large format of the book. 
                    <br></br>
                    When the original hardback and slip-cased edition was remade as a paperback, the spine transformed from a somber black and white all-caps Helvetica treatment to an explosion of offset-printed color as each printing plate (cyan, magenta, yellow) was shifted and printed one on top of each other. The overprinted spine is the product of thinking design through its production which is the hallmark of Muriel Cooper’s work
