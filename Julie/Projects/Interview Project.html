        <p><em>How would you describe My Burberry?</em><br></br>


        It’s pretty <font color="66FF33">fucking delicious</font>. The first time I smelled it, I tried to lick it. It’s got quite an edible smell to it. It brings back memories of <font color="66FF33">England</font> and home and outside. There’s something just homey about it. I can’t describe what it is. It’s obviously quite nature-y as well. It’s kind of like an indoor/outdoor smell. It smells like <font color="66FF33">wet trees</font>. <br></br>

        <em>Since My Burberry captures the scent of a London garden after the rain, what are the smells that characterize London for you?<br></br></em>

        Just that smell of London—I can’t really describe it.When I go back, it hits you when you get off the plane. And the smell of <font color="66FF33">fish and chips</font>. I love it! <Br></br>

        <em>Shooting the My Burberry campaign was your first time working with Kate Moss. What was it like being caught in a rainstorm with her?<br></br></em>

        It was <font color="66FF33">hysterical</font>. We always have fun together. And so to work with Mario [Testino] and Christopher [Bailey], as well…I could spend my whole day like that. I think trying to get us to stop nattering and chatting was probably quite hard. But then they captured that, so it was great. It was just us, being <font color="66FF33">friends</font> and having a good time. <br></br>

        </p>

        </div>


<div class="textbox2">

        <p><em>If you were to have your way with a Burberry trench, how would you make it your own?</em><br></br>


        I’d cover the whole thing in little <font color="66FF33">doodles</font>—little pen doodles all over it. But really small so you can’t see what they are from far away, but up close it’s like a story. I’d definitely do it. Just me and a <font color="66FF33">Sharpie</font>. <br></br>

        <em>Of your tattoos, which one is your favorite? What is the next one going to be?</em><br></br>

        The one on the back of my neck. I got it done in Thailand. It was done with a <font color="66FF33">bamboo stick</font> and a needle. It was painful but also very cool. It’s written in this ancient language from before Sanskrit. It means <font color="66FF33">courage, happiness, peace, and clarity</font>. <br></br>

        <em>You had your brows bleached this past season. What was it like seeing yourself without your beauty signature?</em><br></br>

        I used to do it a lot more. When I first started modeling, they used to <font color="66FF33">bleach</font> my eyebrows all the time. I used to think people hated them. I tried so hard to get out of doing it this time. When they dye them back, something almost always ends up going wrong. Either they are too dark, or one is a different color than the other. But it was weird because I hadn’t seen them like that in a while. I looked like an <font color="66FF33">albino baby</font>. <br></br>

<div class="textbox3">

        <p><em>What was your favorite moment from that shoot that the world didn’t get to see?</em><br></br>


        It think it was probably when we were both <font color="66FF33">naked</font> and she had her legs wrapped around me, but then it was quite hard to stay covered with the <font color="66FF33">trenchcoats</font>. <br></br>

        <em>What is the biggest thing Kate taught you?</em><br></br>

        Just to be myself and not to give a shit what other people say. And stick up for yourself. She’s an extremely strong woman, and she doesn’t take shit from anyone, which is great. She very much sticks up for something she believes in. It’s very <font color="66FF33">inspirational</font>.<br></br>

        <em>What was the first fragrance you ever wore?</em><br></br>

        <font color="66FF33">Britney Spears</font>. Oh, but there was a <font color="66FF33">Pocahontas</font> one. But, yeah, there was Britney Spears. She’s had so many. I can’t remember which one it was. The Pocahontas one was definitely my favorite. The Britney one was more like I stole it from my sister. But as a young girl, I used to get grass and I used to rub it on myself because I loved the smell so much. It was fun. <br></br>

        <div class="boxmodel2"><p> Despite all that, the girl has a<br> killer work ethic, as evidenced<br> by her near ubiquitousness on<br> newsstands; her model-scout-<br>ing efforts for DKNY and Marc<br> by Marc Jacobs; a line of bags<br> designed for Mulberry; and an<br> IMDb CV that lists six upcom-<br>ing projects. But most recently,<br> what may have caught your<br> eye is Delevingne frolicking in<br> the “rain” with fellow supe Kate<br> Moss in the ads for Burberry’s<br> newest scent, My Burberry.

        <p><em>Do you pluck your own eyebrows?</em><br></br>


        I let them go, but if I do <font color="66FF33">pluck</font> them, I just do in there [gesturing to between her brows]. And then I don’t need to shape them ever. <br></br>

        <em>Is there a secret to getting your signature bed head?</em><br></br>

       I never do anything to my hair. I just wash it. It tends to get dry, so I just try to put good, natural oils in it. I do a deep conditioning mask, which is quite good. <br></br>

        <em>You are pretty vocal about your love of bacon. What is it about bacon that gets you?</em><br></br>

        I love everything about it—the <font color="66FF33">touch, the feel, the taste, the smell, the fucking way it looks. Everything.</font> I eat it on its own, for sure. Just straight-up <font color="66FF33">bacon.</font>  <br></br>
