            <p> Free to Air is a series of exhibitions, screenings and events in London which set out to explore the multiple meanings of ‘freedom’ in contemporary society produced by Film and Video Umbrella and inspired by the liberated graphic approach of activist related ephemera, the aim was to create an identity which provoked association with the language of counter culture.</p>

            <p>Part 2 responds to the theme ‘freedom from want’. Alongside the general printed and digital components a poster campaign was conceived focusing on ‘basic human needs’ conveyed through a series of elementary still-life photographs.</p>
