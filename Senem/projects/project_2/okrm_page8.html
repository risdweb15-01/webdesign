            <p> Commissioned in 1616, the Queen’s House is one of the most important buildings in British architectural history, being the first consciously classical building to have been constructed in Britain. It was Jones’s first major commission after returning from his 1613–1615 grand tour of Roman, Renaissance and Palladian architecture in Italy. The building reflects Renaissance ideals of mathematical, classical proportion and harmony which would have appeared revolutionary to English eyes in its day. </p>

            <p>We were commissioned at the start of a two year master plan to review a new environmental graphics and way-finding scheme. The first step was to remove the myriad of municipal design languages that have crept in to the building in recent years. The new design idea carefully observes the historical legacy of the house whilst acknowledging the contemporary context within which it exists. </p>
