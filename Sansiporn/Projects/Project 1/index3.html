                <p><font size="6">M</font>uch has been written over the years about Hayao Miyazaki. Fans of his work speak of him in reverential tones. The richness of his characters, the beauty of his designs, the underlying themes of his stories merely hint at the complexity of his films, which consistently break Japanese box office records and, in the case of Spirited Away, have won an Academy Award. 
                Add to this last year’s revelation that he was retiring, it’s understandable the commotion around his latest, and purportedly last feature, The Wind Rises, would be intense.</p>

                      <font size="5">Q:</font> Why tell this story? 
                      What originally attracted you to this story and what compelled you to create both
                      the Manga and eventually an animated feature?
                  </div>
                    <font size="5">A:</font> At first, I had drawn a Manga, as a hobby actually. My producer, Mr. Suzuki looked at it and said, “Why don’t you make a movie about this?” That was the starting point. But I refused, many times, saying, “This won’t make a good movie” because we would have to leave children aside. 
                    This movie would be more focused for adults.

                     <p> <font size="5">Q:</font> What in particular about the themes of this story resonated with you, moved you enough to want to make a movie?</p>
                  </div>
                    <font size="5">A:</font>  As I was growing up, I remember the last years of World War II. Jiro Horikoshi and Hori Tatsuo were two people that were very interesting to me. Both experienced very sad things in their lives during that period. From the tragedy they experienced, these two people, as I continued to look at them, became the one protagonist in my film

                      <font size="5">Q:</font> Since originally you refused to make this film because it wouldn’t be for kids, now that you have made the movie, do you think kids will enjoy it? Does it have a message for kids as well as for adults?
                  </div>
                    <font size="5">A:</font> One of the staff at the studio mentioned that even if kids don’t understand the film now, the day will come when they will. They will remember the film and understand it. I mentioned to our staff that somehow, we are digging our own grave in a way by creating this film [laughs].

                  <div class="question questionright">
                      <font size="5">Q:</font> It’s safe to say you haven’t dug any graves by making this film. What were the biggest challenges you faced, both you as the director and the studio as a whole, in making this film?
                  </div>
                    <font size="5">A:</font>  First of all, the style of the movie represents a time that is completely different from the one we live in today. The way Japanese people behaved politely during that time is completely different now. How to sit on a tatami, for instance. We needed to imagine what Japan was like when the air was less polluted than today. That was one of the biggest challenges that we faced in making this film.

                      <font size="5">Q:</font> I’ve read this will be your last film and that you’re retiring. I’ve also read that it won’t be your last film and that you aren’t retiring. Is this your last film? Are you retiring?
                  </div>
                    <font size="5">A:</font> I shouldn’t have done that press conference saying to everyone that I’m taking my retirement. The ones closest to me don’t actually believe me [laughs]. I did not think The Wind Rises would be my last film when I started the production. It was only after the production was finished that I thought, “OK, this will be my last film.”

                      <font size="5">Q:</font> This film has been met with controversy in Japan. You have been accused of being pro-military, anti-military. When you chose to make this film, did you anticipate such controversy?
                  </div>
                    <font size="5">A:</font> In one way, I predicted it. But in another way, I thought the controversy and discussions would go much deeper than the ones I see today. I thought about how we should face these chaotic situations we face right now, how we should live in such difficult times. I thought the discussions would be deeper in that sense.

                  </div>
                    <font size="5">A:</font> Americans understand my films in many different ways. I never wanted to create a film where you can easily say “This is yes” or “This is no” or it’s easy to put the “X” in a circle. Things are way more difficult and complex. History is as well. We can’t easily just say “Yes” or “No” to how we look at things.

                  </div>
                    <font size="5">A:</font> Speaking from my own experience, I would say you shouldn’t grow your studio too big. Actually, Studio Ghibli has grown maybe too much. I think 100 employees would have been ideal. When we needed to start using computers, the number of employees grew. We’ve had no choice but to grow bigger. You hire more people, you need more money so of course, you need to make more films.

                  </div>
                    <font size="5">A:</font> Yes, there are a couple. First of all, I’m an animator. There are a couple scenes I created that I liked very much. Actually, it was from when I wasn’t working as a director. It was very fun to work as an animator. A director thinks more general than individual. It was always hard work to be a director.

There are exhibition projects to do at the Ghibli Museum as well as short films we show only at the museum. I also want to continue working on some Manga that I do for a hobby. I will stay busy as usual
