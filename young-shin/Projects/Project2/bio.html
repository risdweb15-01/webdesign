	    		<p>Experimental Jetset is a small, independent, Amsterdam-based graphic design studio, founded in 1997 by Marieke Stolk, Erwin Brinkers and Danny van den Dungen. Focusing on printed matter and site-specific installations, and describing their methodology as “turning language into objects”, Experimental Jetset have worked on projects for a wide variety of institutes. Their work has been featured in group exhibitions such as ‘Graphic Design: Now in Production’ and ‘Ecstatic Alphabets / Heaps of Language’ (MoMA, 2012).</p> 
	    		<p>Solo exhibitions include ‘Kelly 1:1’ and ‘Two or Three Things I Know About Provo’. In 2007, a large selection of work by Experimental Jetset was acquired by the Museum of Modern Art in New York, for inclusion in the MoMA’s permanent collection.
				Members of Experimental Jetset have been teaching at the Gerrit Rietveld Academie (between 2000 and 2010), and are currently teaching again, at both the Werkplaats Typografie (Arnhem) and the Gerrit Rietveld Academie (Amsterdam).</p>
