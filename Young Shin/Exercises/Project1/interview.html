                    MC:So 10 years in, how's it feel to hit that milestone?</p>
                <p class="ee">
                    SH: Ten years. I never imagined working on the show to this date and this long. It never was possible to conceive that.... I really figured we might get a season and a cult following, and that might be it.
                </p>
                <p class="er">MC: When did you become convinced that the show was beyond short-term cult status?</p>
                <p class="ee">SH: By the third season, it felt like we had a solid fan base, and the show was kind of clicking on all levels.</p>
                <p class="er">MC: With an underwater sponge for a star, perhaps no show is more acutely aware of -- creatively -- not wanting to "jump the shark." It that something you've been conscious of?</p>
                <p class="ee">SH: Well, there was concern when we did the movie [in 2004] that the show had peaked. There was concerns among executives at Nickelodeon.</p>
                <p class="er">MC: Rewatching the pilot, "Help Wanted," so much of the style and polish are already in place. But do you see flaws and rough edges when you watch it now?</p>
                <p class="ee">SH: The first season, it definitely looks a little loose and the characters are drawn without the same construction. By the third season, everyone had new kinds of tricks -- three-quarter-views of the characters, and nuances in cross-pollination between different storyboards. Everybody influenced each other as the show evolved and became more complicated and nuanced.</p>
